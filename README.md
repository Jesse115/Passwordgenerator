# Passwordgenerator
Sorry my password Generator is late, i was very sick last week. i am turning it in this week and I hope i can still get it graded. 

Objective 
Create a password generator that 
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

I hope i met all the Acceptance Criteria i worked very hard and fast to complete this and my other project in the same week.

I added all the javascript code to acomplish this task and did alot of googling to make sure i did it properly

i change a few colors to make it my own, this was a fun project to do.
